# ebayScrapper_simple
This is a ebay listing scrapper made in python just for fun  

The ideia is to list products you search on ebay ...  
In this script you can:  
- Search multiple pages  
- Search by price  
- Search by lowest price  
- Search by highest price  
- Search in between prices  


You also should use python3.6 (recomended by requests)  


This was made for fun so don't take this to seriously!
